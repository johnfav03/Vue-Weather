# Vue-Weather

> This project was meant to help learn front-end frameworks like Vue.js as well as API integration
basics; it uses the Vue to display the site, and the OpenWeather API to give locationally based
weather forecasts. In addition, the background changes in coordination with temperature.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification

```
